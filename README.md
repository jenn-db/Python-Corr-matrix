# Python for Data Analysis

I used libraries like seaborn and Matplotlib to showcase the relationship between sales, profit, and discount. By analyzing this plot, we can see whether discounts positively or negatively impact the company's profitability, and we can identify any trends or patterns that may exist in the data.


Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the correlation between discounts, sales, and profit, which can help inform the company's sales and pricing strategies in the future.
