# Python for Data Analysis - Projects

Skills used: matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn, webscraping

## Project 1 - Python Scatterplot and Correlation Matrix

I used libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to showcase the relationship between sales, profit, and discount. By analyzing this plot, we can see whether discounts positively or negatively impact the company's profitability, and we can identify any trends or patterns that may exist in the data.

Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the correlation between discounts, sales, and profit, which can help inform the company's sales and pricing strategies in the future.

## Project 2 - Webscraping a table from Wikipedia

I used BeautifulSoup and requests to webscrape the 4th table [from this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_operating_systems#Commands) that compares operating systems.
